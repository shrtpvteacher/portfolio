        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-8 text-purple-300">About Me</h1>

        <p className="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          I am a self-taught full stack Web3 engineer with a builder’s mindset and a deeply hands-on approach to both life and software. From restoring hardware to wiring solar power, from smart contract security to solving real-world problems with code—everything I do centers around learning, building, and improving.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-purple-400">How It Started</h2>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          My development journey began in the summer of 2021 after I lost money in a honeypot crypto scam. That loss was a wake-up call. I decided I needed to learn how smart contracts really worked so I could read, understand, and eventually write them myself. I chose Solidity as my first programming language and committed fully to becoming a builder.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-purple-400">Builder by Nature</h2>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Long before I touched a single line of code, I was already building and fixing things. I used to repair and refurbish computers, phones, monitors, and tablets. I’ve also created curriculum during my years as a teacher and made custom jewelry. I live off-grid in the Santa Cruz Mountains, where I’ve taught myself how to wire 120V and 220V electrical systems and maintain subpanels to keep everything running.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          These hands-on skills have shaped the way I approach software development: with resourcefulness, creativity, and a willingness to keep going until the job is done.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-purple-400">From Frustration to Innovation</h2>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Many of my personal projects—and even life skills—are born out of frustration. When I come up against something broken, missing, or poorly designed, I do not see it as a dead end. I see it as a challenge, and more often than not, an opportunity in disguise.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          One example: I had to learn how to fix my own car when it broke down deep in the mountains. No mechanic was going to come out to help. At first, it felt overwhelming—but that obstacle became a reason to learn, grow, and take ownership. Thanks to the incredible generosity of people sharing their knowledge on YouTube, I was able to learn step by step how to get it running again.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          That experience taught me something that applies far beyond engines: with persistence, resourcefulness, and access to shared knowledge, most problems can be solved. Whether I am debugging a smart contract, wiring solar, or building a new app, I approach obstacles the same way—by asking what I can learn and how I can turn that problem into progress.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-purple-400">Always Learning, Always Iterating</h2>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          I am still expanding my technical stack and learning new languages in service of the ideas I want to build. I do not pretend to know everything. But I know how to work, how to dig into a problem, and how to keep going until a solution emerges. Sometimes that means repurposing tools that already exist. Other times, it means creating something from the ground up.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          I believe iteration is the engine of good software—and of personal growth.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-purple-400">Why I Build</h2>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          My goal is not just to solve problems for myself but to create tools and systems that help others too. If something I build can make someone’s life easier, more efficient, or more fair—that is the highest return on investment I could ask for.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg mt-4 leading-relaxed">
          I build because I believe in better. And I believe we can get there—one tool, one fix, one line of code at a time.
